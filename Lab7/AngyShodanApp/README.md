Lab 7
_______________________________
This was an individual lab.


For Lab 7, we had to create two data virtualizations for the contents of our mongo database. I struggled a lot with this lab since Angular stopped working for me after Lab 6. While I can run the application through a virtual machine, it takes quite a toll on my laptop. Also, the D3 documentation was confusing to understand. I tried running the sample d3 application on LMS but I still have issues. The good thing is the node server works.
