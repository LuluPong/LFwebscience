Lab 4
______________

**Received Extension until Saturday EOD from Prof. Callahan**

**Individual Lab**

For this lab, we had to convert our Lab 3 project into an Angular application. 

To be frank, this was a mind-numbingly frustrating lab. Working with typescript was a pain. Working with Angular was even more of a pain. A lot of features I was able to implement with vanilla JS were no longer possible to implement w/ typescript. Another frustrating discovery was that the formatting I did with Bootstrap in Lab 3, did not work with my Angular. While a major part of Angular is using components, I felt like the components where EXTREMELY detrimental to my project. For some odd reason, using a normal the forms that I created ipform and linkform created duplicate body tags. I dont know why and can't find a reason online for something like that to happen. If this were a multi-page project, I could see the usefulness of Angular but my application is only a single page application. The time it took me to complete Lab 3 is no where near the amount of time it took to complete Lab 4 and my application is in shambles.
