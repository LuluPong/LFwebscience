Lab 4

I FINALLY GOT MY ANGULAR LAB 4 TO COMMIT TO GITHUB

-------------------------
I had to reinstall Github Desktop since it was somehow corrupted. My previous README is still available in my history. I have not made any changes to my Angular application since Saturday night. Again, a very frustrating lab w/ Github only compounding my frustrations.
