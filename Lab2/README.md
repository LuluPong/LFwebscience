Lab 2

Individual Lab
-------------------
For this lab, we used the openweathermap API to display weather information about a user's specific location. I used HTML geolocation 
to pull the device's location via coordinates. Then I plugged the saved coordinates into a getJSON function that provided all the necessary
info needed to call return the JSON. From there, I plugged the JSON components into methods that appended the data to HTML content.

For CSS, I wanted to keep the design simple. Since my theme was 'weather on the go', I wanted the design to be simple enough for a user to get the information 
they need quickly (No bells and whistles). I originally planned to use an iphone background and display the info within that iphone background;
however, I thought I could create my own iphone screen border using Bootstrap and ended up doing something completely different. I decided against using 
animations for the main content since the  weather data was being fetched on page load. If the data takes a little longer than usual to get,
the animations would be out of synch with the time it takes to display the data.

I am glad we had this lab. Having very little experience with APIs and not doing too well with reading JSON data and outputting them to 
my HTML pages, this lab helped me get a better understanding of how to use APIs and how to read JSON files. I also feel more a little 
more comfortable using Javascript now.



**3 APIs examined:**

    ->API Football
    (An API that contains data on various soccer information (Players, game stats, team stats, leaderboards). The API can be accessed with a variety 
    of languages. Requires an account to use but is free for basic API calls.)
    
    ->Yahoo Finance
    (An API that contains a wide variety of financial data. The API is free and can be accessed using a plethora of languages.)
    
    ->Coinbase API
    (An API that contains data on the cryptocurrency market. Information about wallets and transactions can also corraled with this API. A coinbase account 
    is required to receive an API key and there is a tedious precious one has to go through before being able to actually use the API.)
