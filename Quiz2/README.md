Quiz 2

_______________________

For quiz 2 I created a base angular application with node running as the backend.
I did not understand the instructions very well. I was not sure if you wanted us to use forms or strictly buttons.
I also had a lot of issues using D3. The backend is mostly done and like 60% working. I was not sure if you wanted use 
to not perform an ETL on the data going to the post endpoint or mongo in general.

While I was able to do the Node stuff relatively quickly, the frontend stuff was a hassle I was not able to overcome.
